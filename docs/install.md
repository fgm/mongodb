# Installation and Settings

To summarize:

- Install prerequisites
- Download the MongoDB module suite to the site
- Configure settings


## Installing the prerequisites

The MongoDB module and submodules need some configuration to be useful.
This guide assumes that :

* A [MongoDB][download] 4.2 to 6.x server instance has already been installed,
  configured and is available for connection from the Drupal instance.
  MongoDB 5.x, AWS DocumentDB and Azure CosmosDB might work but are not tested.
  Be sure to [report any issue][report] you could have with either.
* The [mongodb][mongodb] (not [mongo][mongo]) PHP extension version 1.13 or
  later is installed and configured.
* The site will be running [Drupal][drupal] 9.4.x, 9.5.x or 10.0.x,
  with [Drush][drush] 11.x.
* PHP is version 8.1.x. PHP 8.2.x should work but is not tested:
  be sure to [report any issue][report] you could have with it.
* We highly recommend [using Composer](#installing-using-composer)
  to install and use this module, and its dependency,
  the [MongoDB extension and library for PHP][PHPMongoDBlib]

Installing MongoDB itself is best explained in these official resources
maintained by MongoDB Inc.:

   * [MongoDB Mac installation][MongoDBMac]
   * [MongoDB LINUX installation][MongoDBLinux]
   * [MongoDB Windows installation][MongoDBWindows]

MongoDB below 4.0 is no longer supported, which means you can no longer get
a basic web admin interface by running `mongod` with the `â€“httpinterface`:
that feature was [removed in 3.6][removedhttp].
To some extent, this feature has been superseded by the
[free cloud monitoring][freemonitoring] service offered by MongoDB Inc.

## Downloading the modules

If you are already using [Composer][composer] in your site to manage module
dependencies, as recommended, installing is just one command:

```bash
cd <site root path>
# Download the tagged (stable) version:
composer require -nvv -W --prefer-stable "drupal/mongodb:^2.1"
# ...or the latest version:
composer require -nvv -W "drupal/mongodb:dev-2.x"
```

Alternatively, download the module package by any other means,
as per the Drupal documentation about [Installing modules][install].


## Configuring settings

* Copy the relevant section from `mongodb/example.settings.local.php` to your
  `settings.local.php` file if you use one, or `settings.php` otherwise,
  and adapt it to match your MongoDB settings.
  These settings are used by the `mongodb` module to connect to your MongoDB servers,
  with the `default` server being the one started in previous steps.
  * The `clients` key contains an associative array of connection by
    connection alias, with the default connection parameters being under the
    `default` key, and additional keys allowing the use of other
    servers/clusters.
  * The `databases` key contains an associative array of server/database pairs
    by database alias, with the default Drupal database being under the
    `default` key, and additional keys allowing modules to use their own
    database to avoid stepping on each other's toes. This is especially useful
    for bespoke modules created for the needs of a specific site, which can thus
    use their own databases, possibly located on other MongoDB clusters.
    For example, consider the following settings:

```php
<?php
// In sites/default/settings.local.php.
$settings['mongodb'] = [
  'clients' => [
    // Client alias => connection constructor parameters.
    'default' => [
      'uri' => 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
      'uriOptions' => [],
      'driverOptions' => [],
    ],
  ],
  'databases' => [
    // Database alias => [ client_alias, database_name ]
    'default' => ['default', 'drupal'],
    'keyvalue' => ['default', 'keyvalue'],
    'logger' => ['default', 'logger'],
    'queue' => ['default', 'queue'],
  ],
];
```

  * With these settings:
    * The `default` database alias will handle collections in the `drupal`
      database on the `default` MongoDB server installed in earlier steps.
    * The `keyvalue` database alias will store key-value collections on the
      same `default` MongoDB server, but in a separate `keyvalue` database.
    * The `logger` database alias will store logger collections on the same
      `default` MongoDB server, but in a separate `logger` database.
    * The `queue` database alias will store queue collections on the same
      `default` MongoDB server, but in a separate `queue` database.

The module contains an example default implementation of these settings, which
you can copy or include, in `mongodb/example.settings.local.php`.

## Enabling the module

Enable the `mongodb` module, using `drush en mongodb` or the Drupal UI.

You now have access to the MongoDB services and Drush/Console commands for the `mongodb` module.

Once the module is installed and enabled, you can check its requirements on
`/admin/reports/status`:

![MongoDB on status page](images/mongodb-requirements.png)

You can configure it on `/admin/config/system/mongodb/watchdog`.

Optionally, enable the [`mongodb_storage`](modules/mongodb_storage.md)
and [`mongodb_watchdog`](modules/mongodb_watchdog.md) modules,
for additional services and commands.
